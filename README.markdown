This is a test project
======================

Hey I might as well learn a bit of [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) while im here.

Objectives
----------

- Learn Git
- Learn Markdown
- Learn Ruby

    And perhaps a bit of code

OK, so it turns out Markdown is pretty straightforward!
